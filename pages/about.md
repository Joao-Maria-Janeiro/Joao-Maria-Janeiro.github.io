I've been fascinated by technology ever since I can remember and, due to that, I started to take a deeper look into programming and every since I tried it I fell in love with it. That passion led me to to the Electrical and Computer Engineering degree where I learned diverse algorithms and data structures. That love also led me to start learning languages, frameworks and concepts on my own and started developing my own projects which you can check [here](https://github.com/Joao-Maria-Janeiro/). With the dream of working at Google for a long time I applied for an internship and got accepted in NY in my sophomore year.
